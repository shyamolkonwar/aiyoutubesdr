**Subject:** Collaboration Inquiry - StudyIQ IAS  

Hi StudyIQ IAS,  

My name is [Your Name], and I’m a huge fan of your channel. I especially enjoyed your latest video, *"Answer Writing Workshop for UPSC 2025 & 2026 | Bhuvan Jha | StudyIQ IAS."* The insights you provide are incredibly valuable for UPSC aspirants.  

I’m reaching out because I work with creators like you to help them scale their businesses. Based on your channel’s focus on UPSC preparation and civil services education, I believe we could be a great fit.  

Would you be open to a quick chat next week to discuss how we can work together?  

Best,  
[Your Name]
